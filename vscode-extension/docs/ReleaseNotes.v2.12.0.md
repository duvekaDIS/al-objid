-   Interactive assignment

## Interactive Assignment

This feature allows you to assign a new object ID from within a custom range you define on the fly. Some companies prefer having their object IDs to be arranged in a specific way, and this feature allows you to do that. When assigning a new object ID, simply specify the minimum and the maximum object ID you want to assign from, and Ninja will assign the next available object ID from that range (or it will let you know if it can't find any available object IDs in that range).
